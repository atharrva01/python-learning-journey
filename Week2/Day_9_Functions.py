#Here we learn't about the functions of string which are as follows:

def multiplication(a,b): # here a,b are parameters
    return a*b

print(multiplication(76,9888)) # here the values in between the parenthesis are the arguments.

#Lambda Funtions 
#this means we can write a function withing a single line also , this is a predefined func by python.

square = lambda x: x*x
print(square(8))

add = lambda x,y : x + y
print(add(76,11))

#in simple language we can say that we use lamda func just to reduce teh lines of code and for our convinience.
